# Automate The Boring Stuff Using Python
My projects' journey of Al Sweigart's book "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python".

This is my solutions to projects that I have met in the book titled above.

I sectioned the exercises by chapters, if you want to know what each exercise does I have made README.md file for every project.

By my programming standards these projects are not that hard to implement, some of them is pretty simple but I just want to try what it is like to learn and practice programming using books.
